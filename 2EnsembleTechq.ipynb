By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, bagging reduces the variance of the model, which helps to prevent overfitting."

However, after reaching a certain threshold, the performance improvement may plateau or even decrease due to diminishing returns or overfitting. The optimal ensemble size depends on factors such as the complexity of the problem, the diversity of base learners, and computational constraints."
